# Base Services

Base Services are common services used by many devices, providing a 
set of interfaces for different devices to interact and interoperate
with one another. Below are the currently supported base services. 
This list will continue to expand as more contributions are made to 
the AllSeen Alliance project.

* [Onboarding][onboarding]. Provide a consistent way to bring a new device onto
  the Wi-Fi network.

* [Notification][notification]. Allows text-based notifications to be sent and 
  received by devices on the AllJoyn&trade; network. Also supports audio and 
  images via URLs.

* [Control Panel][controlpanel]. Allows devices to advertise a virtual control
  panel to be controlled remotely.

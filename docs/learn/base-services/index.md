# Base Services

Base Services is a collection of common services useful to nearly all devices.

The following services are provided in the latest release:

* [Onboarding][_o]. Simplify the process of bringing a new device onto
the AllJoyn&trade; network.

* [Notification][_n]. Provide a uniform method for sending and receiving
notifications on the AllJoyn&trade; network, with support for text, image, and
audio message content.

* [Control Panel][_cp]. Support remote control of devices through a
standard service description.

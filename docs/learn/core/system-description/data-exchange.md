# Data Exchange

## Overview

The AllJoyn&trade; provider application implements one or more service 
objects that provide service functionality. These service objects 
implement one or more Bus interfaces which support methods, signals, 
and/or properties as interface members. AllJoyn applications can 
exchange data using these interface members. An AllJoyn session 
must be established to exchange data between provider and consumer 
applications except when sending sessionless signals 
(see [Sessionless Signal][sessionless-signal]). 

**NOTE:** AllJoyn service objects are not tied to any specific 
AllJoyn session. Any service object can be accessed over any AllJoyn session.

The following figure shows the functional architecture for 
the provider application. 

![provider-functional-arch][provider-functional-arch]

**Figure:** Provider functional architecture

Aspects about the architecture follow.

* Each service object has an associated object path which app 
may decide to announce as part of About feature's announcement signal. 
* A provider device can host one or more AllJoyn sessions. 
* The provider app maintains distinct session port and a 
session Id for each hosted session among other parameters. 
* The provider application endpoint connected to the AllJoyn 
router has one associated unique name and one or more well-known 
names advertised by the application. 
* The AllJoyn router maintains session related state information. 

This information is used to perform sessionId-based routing 
for AllJoyn messages. 

Once a session is established, the provider application can 
communicate with consumer apps via interface methods and 
properties when invoked by the consumer side. The provider 
app can also send signals specified in the bus interfaces 
to send data to consumer apps.

After an AllJoyn session is established, the consumer application 
has the connection established to exchange data with the provider 
app. The consumer app in a session can invoke methods and properties 
on the remote service objects, or can opt to receive signals 
emitted by the provider app. A ProxyBusObject is needed to 
exchange data via methods and properties. A signal handler 
is needed to receive signal data from the provider app.

The following figure shows the functional architecture for 
the consumer application. 

![consumer-functional-arch][consumer-functional-arch]

**Figure:** Consumer functional architecture

Aspects of this architecture follow.

* A consumer app can join one or more AllJoyn sessions which 
can be with the same or different provider apps. 
* The consumer app creates one or more proxy objects, one 
for each remote service object it wants to communicate with. 
* A proxy object is a local representation of the desired 
remote service object on the provider app. 
* The service object path, unique name of the provider app 
and sessionId information are provided to create a proxy object. 
* To receive signals from the provider app, consumer app 
registers specific signal handlers with the AllJoyn router 
for signal names specified in the service object. 
* When a particular signal is received, specified signal 
handler gets invoked.
* The consumer application endpoint connected to the AllJoyn 
router has one associated unique name. 
* The AllJoyn router maintains session-related state information 
for the joined sessions. This information is used to perform 
sessionId based routing for AllJoyn messages.

## Data exchange via methods

The following use cases illustrate data exchange via method calls:

* Provider app sending a reply
* Provider app not sending a reply

### Provider app sending a reply

The following figure captures the message flow for the scenario 
when a consumer app remotely invokes a method call on the 
provider app to exchange data. A METHOD_RETURN reply message 
is sent back to the consumer app.

![data-exchange-method-calls-reply-sent][data-exchange-method-calls-reply-sent]

**Figure:** Data exchange via method calls (reply sent)

The message flow steps are described below.

1. Both the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn 
router and perform advertisement and discovery steps to 
discover desired services.
2. The provider app registers its service objects with the 
AllJoyn core library. This step is needed to expose service 
objects to remote nodes on the network. The AllJoyn core library 
adds a MethodHandler for all the methods associated with a 
given service object.
3. The provider app binds a session port with the AllJoyn 
router via the AllJoyn core library's BindSessionPort API. 
This call specifies a session port, session options and a 
SessionPortListener for the session.
4. The provider and consumer apps perform AllJoyn service 
advertisement and discovery to discover the service offered 
by the provider app.
5. The consumer app establishes an AllJoyn session with the 
provider app over the bound session port. Now there is a 
session connection established between provider and consumer 
app to exchange data.
6. The consumer app creates a proxyBusObect via the AllJoyn 
core library's GetProxyBusObjcet API. The app specifies unique 
name of provider app, object path for the service object, 
sessionId, and list of BusInterfaces to which the proxy 
object should respond.
7. The consumer app gets the BusInterface from the created 
proxy object and calls a method on this BusInterface. 
The app provides input parameters for the method.
8. The ProxyBusObject:MethodCall method is called, which 
generates an AllJoyn METHOD_CALL message for the method call.
9. The proxy object sends the generated METHOD_CALL message 
to the AllJoyn router.
10. The AllJoyn router receives the message and determines 
where this message needs to be routed based on the 
session ID/destination information included in the message. 
In this case, the message needs to be routed to remote 
AllJoyn router endpoint at the provider.
11. The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to the 
remote AllJoyn router over the established session connection. 
The METHOD_CALL message includes a serial number, service 
objectPath, interfaceName in the service object, member name 
(method name) within the interfaceName, sessionId, and sender 
unique name as part of the header fields of the message. 
The method input parameters are included as part of the message body.
12. The provider AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_CALL 
message. It determines where this message needs to be 
routed based on the session ID/destination information. 
In this case, the message needs to be routed to the AllJoyn 
core library app endpoint. 
13. The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to 
the AllJoyn core library endpoint. 
14. The AllJoyn core library invokes the registered MethodHandler 
for the method call member specified in the received message. 
The MethodHandler invokes the actual method call with the 
BusInterface of the service object and receives the method 
response. It generates a METHOD_RETURN message for the method 
reply and sends to the AllJoyn router. 
15. The AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN message 
and determines where this message needs to be routed based 
on session ID/destination information included in the message. 
In this case, the message needs to be routed to the remote 
AllJoyn router endpoint at the consumer.
   * The provider AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN 
   message to the remote AllJoyn router over established 
   session connection. The METHOD_RETURN message includes a 
   reply serial number (serial number of the associated METHOD_CALL 
   message), sessionId, and sender's unique name as part of 
   message header fields.  Any output parameters for the 
   METHOD_RETURN message is specified as part of the message body.
  * The consumer AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN 
  message. It determines where this message needs to be routed 
  based on the session ID/destination information. In this case, 
  the message needs to be routed to the app endpoint.
  * The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN message to the 
  application's endpoint with output parameters as the response 
  to the original METHOD_CALL message. If the METHOD_CALL message 
  was sent asynchronously, a ReplyHandler gets registered which 
  is invoked when the METHOD_RETURN message is received.

### Provider app not sending a reply

When defining an interface definition, the provider can annotate 
some methods that are not returning any output parameters as 
NO_REPLY_EXPECTED. For such methods, the provider app will not 
be sending any METHOD_RETURN message back to the consumer. 
When invoking such a method, the consumer should set the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED 
flag to indicate to the AllJoyn core library that it does 
not need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.

The following figure shows the message flow for the scenario 
when a method is invoked with the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED flag set, 
and no reply is sent by the provider app.

![data-exchange-method-calls-reply-not-sent][data-exchange-method-calls-reply-not-sent]

**Figure:** Data exchange via method calls (reply not sent)

Most of the message flow steps are similar to the reply sent 
message flow returning a method reply. The following captures 
the distinguishing steps with respect to that flow.

1. When defining a service interface, provider app annotates 
one or more methods in the interface as NO_REPLY_EXPECTED. 
The service object implementing the service interface gets 
registered with the AllJoyn core library.
2. On the consumer side, when that method call is invoked 
via ProxyObject interfaces, the consumer sets the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED 
flag. This indicates to the AllJoyn core library that it does 
not need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.
3. The METHOD_CALL message reaches the provider app and the 
associated method gets invoked. Since the method was annotated 
with NO_REPLY_EXPECTED, the provider app does not generate any reply.

## Data exchange via signals

The following figure captures the message flow for the scenario 
when consumer app registers to receive signals from the provider 
app to exchange data. 

![data-exchange-signals][data-exchange-signals]

**Figure:** Data exchange via signals

A signal gets forwarded to all participants in a session if 
only sessionId is specified in the header (no destination field). 

If a specific destination is specified in the header field, 
then the signal is only sent to that participant.

The message flow steps are described below.

1. Both the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn 
router and perform advertisement and discovery steps to 
discover desired services.
2. The provider app registers its service objects with the 
AllJoyn core library. This step is needed to expose service 
objects to remote nodes on the network. The AllJoyn core 
library adds a MethodHandler for all the methods associated 
with a given service object.
3. The provider app binds a session port with the AllJoyn 
router via the AllJoyn core library's BindSessionPort API. 
This call specifies a session port, session options, and a 
SessionPortListener for the session.
4. The provider and consumer apps perform AllJoyn service 
advertisement and discovery to discover the service offered 
by the provider app.
5. The consumer app establishes an AllJoyn session with 
the provider app over the bound session port. Now there 
is a session connection established between provider and 
consumer app to exchange data.
6. The consumer app registers a signal handler for receiving 
specific signal from the provider side service object by 
invoking RegisterSignalHandler API with the AllJoyn core library. 
The app specifies the interface name for the interface which 
includes the signal, name of the signal, object path for 
the object receiving the signal, signal handler method, 
and source object path for signal emitter.
7. The AllJoyn core library invokes an AddMatch call with 
the AllJoyn router to register the rule to receive this signal. 
This rule specifies type=signal, interface name, signal 
member name, and source object path for the object generating the signal.
8. When the provider app has the signal to send, it invokes 
the BusObject Signal(...) call specifying all the signal 
parameters. This call generates an AllJoyn SIGNAL message. 
9. The SIGNAL message gets sent to the AllJoyn router. 
10. The AllJoyn router receives the SIGNAL message and 
determines where this message needs to be routed based 
on the session ID/destination information included in the 
message. In this case, the message needs to be routed to 
remote AllJoyn router endpoint at the consumer.
11. The consumer AllJoyn router receives the signal and 
filters it based on registered match rules. In this case, 
the signal matches the registered rule. The AllJoyn router 
sends the received SIGNAL message to the AllJoyn core library app endpoint.
12. The AllJoyn core library calls the registered signal 
handler for the signal passing the received signal message parameters. 

## Data exchange via property

The provider and consumer apps can exchange data via property 
members defined in the BusInterfaces of the service object. 
A property member has predefined get and set method calls 
to get the value of the property and to set a specific value 
on the property. The consumer app can invoke these get and 
set method calls for the property to exchange data. 

To invoke these property methods, the message flow detailed 
for method calls in [Data exchange via methods][data-exchange-via-methods] applies.

## Signal versus (method call without reply)

It is good to understand the difference between a signal and 
method call without a reply. In both cases, a single message 
is sent from the source; however, these are quite different. 
One of the main differences is that they are sent in different 
directions. A SIGNAL message is emitted by the provider app, 
whereas a METHOD_CALL message is sent by the consumer app. 
In addition, a SIGNAL message can be sent to be received by 
either a single destination or by multiple destinations, 
whereas the METHOD_CALL message is always sent to a single destination.

## Match rules

The AllJoyn framework supports D-Bus match rules for the consumer 
application to request and receive specific set of messages. 
Match rules describe the messages that should be sent to a 
consumer app based on the contents of the message. Match rules 
are typically used to receive a specific set of signal messages. 
Consumer apps can ask to receive specific set of signals from 
the AllJoyn router by specifying filtering/matching rules for signals. 

Signals that are sent to a specific destination do not need 
to match the consumer's match rule. Instead, match rules are 
applied to signals which are not sent to a specific destination; 
they are meant to be received by multiple endpoints. These 
include broadcast signals, sessionless signals and session-specific 
signals sent to multiple participants in the session. 
Such signals get forwarded to only those consumer applications 
that have a suitable match rule. This avoids unnecessary waking 
up and processing for signals at the consumer applications.

Consumer applications can add a match rule by using the AddMatch 
method exposed by the AllJoyn router. Match rules are specified 
as a string of comma-separated key/value pairs. Excluding a key 
from the rule indicates a wildcard match, e.g., excluding the 
member key from a match rule but adding a sender lets all 
messages from that sender through. 

For example:

```c
Match Rule = 
"type='signal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus',interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',
member='Foo',path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'"
```

The AllJoyn framework supports a subset of D-Bus match rules 
as captured in [Match rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework][match-rule-keys]. 

**NOTE:** The AllJoyn does not support D-Bus specified arg[0,1...N], 
arg[0,1,...N]path, arg0namespace and eavesdrop='true' in match rules.

### Match rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework

| Match key | Possible values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| type | <ul><li>signal</li><li>method_call</li><li>method_return</li><li>error</li></ul> | Match on the message type. An example of a type match is type='signal'. |
| sender | A well-known name or unique name | Match messages sent by a particular sender. An example of a sender match is sender='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'. |
| interface | An interface name | Match messages sent over or to a particular interface. An example of an interface match is interface='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'. If a message omits the interface header, it must not match any rule that specifies this key. |
| member | Any valid method or signal name | Matches messages which have the give method or signal name. An example of a member match is member='NameOwnerChanged'. |
| path | An object path | Matches messages which are sent from or to the given object. An example of a path match is path='/org/alljoyn/Refrigerator'. |
| path_namespace | An object path | <p>Matches messages which are sent from or to an object for which the object path is either the given value, or that value followed by one or more path components.</p><p>For example, path_namespace='/com/example/foo' would match signals sent by /com/example/foo or by /com/example/foo/bar, but not by /com/example/foobar.</p><p>Using both path and path_namespace in the same match rule is not allowed.</p> |
| destination | A unique name | Matches messages which are being sent to the given unique name. An example of a destination match is destination=':100.2'. |

An application can add multiple match rules for signals with the 
AllJoyn router. In this case, the app is essentially requesting 
to get signal messages based on multiple filtering criteria, and 
all match rules are applicable. As a result, the signal messages 
get sent to the app if they matches any of the specified match rules. 

The AllJoyn router sends a union of messages to the app that 
matches with the specified rules. For example, if there is a 
more restrictive rule that matches a small set of signals, 
and there is another less restrictive rule that matches a 
larger superset of signals, the AllJoyn router always sends 
the larger superset of signals to the app.

## Type system 

The AllJoyn framework uses the D-Bus protocol type system 
which allows values of various types to be serialized in a 
standard way into a sequence of bytes referred to as the 
wire format. Converting values from some other representation 
into the wire format is called marshaling, and converting it 
back from the wire format is called unmarshaling. 

The AllJoyn framework uses D-Bus marshaling format.

### Type signatures

The AllJoyn framework uses the same type signatures that 
are used by the D-Bus protocol. The type signature is made 
up of type codes. The type code is an ASCII character that 
represents a standard data type. 

#### Data types supported by the AllJoyn framework

| Conventional name | Code | ASCII | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| INVALID | 0 | NUL | Not a valid type code, used to terminate signatures. |
| BYTE | 121 | 'y' | 8-bit unsigned integer. |
| BOOLEAN | 98 | 'b' | Boolean value, 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE. Everything else is invalid. |
| INT16 | 110 | 'n' | 16-bit signed integer. |
| UINT16 | 113 | 'q' | 16-bit unsigned integer. |
| INT32 | 105 | 'i' | 32-bit signed integer. |
| UINT32 | 117 | 'u' | 32-bit unsigned integer. |
| UINT64 | 120 | 'x' | 64-bit signed integer. |
| DOUBLE | 100 | 'd' | IEEE 754 double. |
| STRING | 115 | 's' | UTF-8 string (must be valid UTF-8). Must be null terminated and contain no other null bytes. |
| OBJECT_PATH | 111 | 'o' | Name of an object instance. |
| SIGNATURE | 103 | 'g' | A type signature. |
| ARRAY	| 97 | 'a' | Array |
| STRUCT | 114, 40, 41 | 'r', '(', ')' | Struct |
| VARIANT | 118 | 'v' | Variant type (the type of the value is part of the value itself). |
| DICT_ENTRY | 101, 123, 125 | 'e','{','}' | Entry in a dict or map (array of key-value pairs). |

Four of the types are container types: STRUCT, ARRAY, VARIANT, 
and DICT_ENTRY. All other types are common basic data types. 
When specifying a STRUCT or DICT_ENTRY, 'r' and 'e' should 
not be used. Instead, ASCII characters '(', ')', '{', and '}' 
should be used to mark the beginning and ending of a container.

## Message format

The AllJoyn framework uses the D-Bus message format and 
extends it with additional header flags and header fields 
for AllJoyn messages. The AllJoyn message format is used 
to send messages between AllJoyn routers as well as between 
the application and the AllJoyn router.

Method calls, method replies and signal messages get encapsulated 
in AllJoyn message format. D-Bus defined METHOD_CALL, METHOD_RETURN 
and SIGNAL messages are used (with AllJoyn enhancements) for 
transporting these messages respectively. In case of error 
scenarios, an ERROR message is returned in reply to a method 
call (instead of METHOD_RETURN). 

An AllJoyn message consists of a header and a body. 
The following figure shows the AllJoyn message format. 
Definitions for each message format field are provided in subsequent tables.

## Message routing

The AllJoyn system supports routing logic to route the following 
categories of messages:

* App-specific messages: These are app-generated messages that 
get routed between app endpoints based on the session ID/destination 
based routing logic described in section 6.9.1.
* Control messages: These messages are generated by the AllJoyn 
router (e.g., AttachSession) that get routed to the local endpoint 
of the AllJoyn router.

### Session ID/destination-based routing   

The AllJoyn system supports message routing based on session ID 
and/or destination fields for app-specific messages. A session 
ID-based routing table is formed and maintained at the AllJoyn 
router for routing messages. A single routing table is maintained 
for all the active sessions. 

Conceptually, for every session ID, the routing table maintains 
a list of destination app endpoints for every app participating 
in the session and next hop bus-to-bus endpoint for those app 
endpoints which are remote. A remote endpoint is attached to 
a different AllJoyn router; however, it can be on the same 
device or on a different device. For destination endpoints that 
are local to the AllJoyn router, no bus-to-bus endpoint is 
maintained in the routing table.

```c
AllJoyn routing table = List (session Id, List (destination app endpoint, 
next hop B2B endpoint))
```

**NOTE:** A given destination endpoint can appear multiple times 
as part of different sessionId entries in an AllJoyn routing 
table. In this case, if there are multiple possible paths to a 
remote destination, different bus-to-bus endpoints can be used 
for the same destination as part of different sessionId entries. 

When selecting a route, sessionId is used first to find a 
matching entry in the routing table. Destination field is used 
next to select a bus-to-bus endpoint (for remote destinations). 

The following figure shows a deployment with two devices having 
an AllJoyn session established between them. All four apps 
are part of the session.

![alljoyn-routing-example][alljoyn-routing-example]

**Figure:** AllJoyn routing example

The AllJoyn router on each of the device maintains a routing 
table. [Sample routing table on provider device][sample-routing-table-on-provider-device] and
[Sample routing table on consumer device][sample-routing-table-on-consumer-device] show sample
AllJoyn routing tables maintained on the provider and consumer 
AllJoyn routers, respectively.

#### Sample routing table on provider device

| Session ID | Destination (app endpoint) | Next hop (B2B endpoint) |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | App1 Endpoint (:100.2) | N/A |
| | App 2 Endpoint (:100.3) | N/A |
| | App 3 Endpoint (:200.2) | B2B Endpoint (:100.4) |
| | App 4 Endpoint (:200.3) | B2B Endpoint (:100.4) |

#### Sample routing table on consumer device

| Session ID | Destination (app endpoint) | Next hop (B2B endpoint) |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | App1 Endpoint (:100.2) | B2B Endpoint (:100.4) |
| | App 2 Endpoint (:100.3) | B2B Endpoint (:100.4) |
| | App 3 Endpoint (:200.2) | N/A |
| | App 4 Endpoint (:200.3) | N/A |

#### Routing table formation

Routing tables are formed based on the bus-to-bus endpoint 
information included in the AttachSession method call. When 
an AllJoyn router receives an AttachSession call, it can be 
from an app trying to form a new session or from a new member 
being added to an existing session. 

* AttachSession for a new session: In this case, the AllJoyn 
router sends an Accept session to the app. (Currently, the 
single-hop use case is captured.)  If the session is accepted, 
it creates a new sessionId. It then adds an entry for that 
sessionId in the routing table with the two participants 
as destinations and bus-to-bus endpoint received in the AttachSession 
as next hop for the remote app endpoint.
* AttachSession from an added member: In this case, the session 
is a multi-point session and the AllJoyn router already has an 
entry for the associated sessionId in the routing table. 
The member from where the AttachSession is received gets added 
as a new destination with the bus-to-bus endpoint in the 
AttachSession as next hop.

#### Routing logic

As described above, the sessionId from the message (if present) 
is used first to find a matching sessionId entry in the routing 
table. Next, the destination field (if present) is used to find 
a matching destination entry to perform the routing. 

The following sections capture the routing logic for different use cases.

##### Routing based on sessionId and destination field

If an app-directed message has a non-zero sessionId as well 
as destination fields, the AllJoyn router first finds that 
sessionId entry in the routing table and then finds the 
destination entry within that sessionId for the message destination. 

* If the destination was a remote endpoint, then the message gets 
sent to the bus-to-bus endpoint specified for that destination in 
the routing table. 
* If the destination is locally attached to the AllJoyn router, 
the message gets directly sent over the local bus connection to 
that destination.

##### Routing based on sessionId field only

If an app-directed message only has a sessionId but no destination 
field, the message gets forwarded to all the destination endpoints 
in that session. The AllJoyn router finds the matching sessionId 
entry in the routing table and send the message to all the destinations 
listed for that session, except the one which sent the message. 
* For remote app endpoints in the session, the message gets 
forwarded to associated bus-to-bus endpoint from the routing table. 
* For locally attached app endpoints in the session, the AllJoyn 
router directly forwards message to those app endpoints over 
the local bus connection. 

##### Routing for sessionId=0

An app-directed message can specify a sessionId=0 or, if no 
sessionId field is included, the AllJoyn router assumes sessionId 
to be 0. The sessionId field value can be zero for any message type. 
For METHOD_CALL, METHOD_RETURN and ERROR messages, the only 
requirement is that the destination field must be specified.  

For messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), 
if a destination field is specified, the AllJoyn router selects 
any available route from the routing table (from any of the 
session entry containing that destination) and forwards the 
message over the bus-to-bus endpoint for that route.

For SIGNAL messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), 
the destination field does not need to be present. In this case, 
the AllJoyn router looks at the GLOBAL_BROADCAST flag in the message 
to determine how that SIGNAL message should be routed per logic below: 

* GLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag set: The SIGNAL message should be globally 
broadcast to all connected endpoints over any session. The Destination 
field is not looked at when routing such a signal message. The AllJoyn 
router sends this message to all destination endpoints from the 
routing table across all sessionIds. 
* For remote destinations, the SIGNAL message gets forwarded to 
the associated bus-to-bus endpoint. 
* For locally connected destination, the message gets forwarded 
directly to the app endpoint over local bus connection.
* GLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag not set: The SIGNAL message should be 
sent over all the locally attached app endpoints. The AllJoyn 
router forwards the message to all of the locally connected 
app endpoint over local bus connection.

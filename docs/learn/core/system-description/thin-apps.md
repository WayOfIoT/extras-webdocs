# Thin Apps

## Overview

The AllJoyn&trade; system is designed to operate across AllJoyn-enabled
devices with different capabilities. The AllJoyn Standard Core Library (AJSCL)
is designed to run on devices that usually have significant
amounts of memory, available energy, and computing power,
along with operating systems that support multiple processes/threads
with multiple standard language environments. The AJSCL is designed
for general purpose computer devices and supports application
running on HLOS including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and OpenWRT.

On the other hand, single-purpose AllJoyn-enabled devices
usually have an embedded system running on a microcontroller
designed to provide specific functionality. Such embedded
systems are optimized to reduce the size and cost of the product,
often by limiting memory size, processor speed, available power,
peripherals, user interfaces, or all of the above.
The AllJoyn Thin Core Library (AJTCL) is designed to bring
the benefits of the AllJoyn distributed programming environment
to embedded system-based devices.

The AJTCL provides a lightweight implementation of core AllJoyn
functionality for embedded microcontroller applications. An embedded
system-based AllJoyn device (thin AllJoyn device) only includes an
AllJoyn thin application utilizing the AJTCL and does not include
an AllJoyn router component because of its resource-constrained
environment. It borrows an AllJoyn router from another standard
AllJoyn-enabled device in the AllJoyn proximal network, and
uses it for core AllJoyn functions including advertisement and
message routing. An AllJoyn thin application is fully compatible
and inter-operable with standard AllJoyn applications on the
AllJoyn proximal network. In fact, a remote application will
not even know that it is talking with an AllJoyn thin application
on the other side.

The following figure shows a context architecture depicting
how AllJoyn thin applications fit in the overall AllJoyn distributed system.

![img thin-app-arch][]

**Figure:** Thin app context architecture

It shows two thin AllJoyn-enabled devices (device 3 and device 4)
with a single AllJoyn thin application installed on each of them.
A thin app is built on top of AJTCL and it connects with the
distributed AllJoyn bus by establishing a connection with an
AllJoyn router on a standard AllJoyn-enabled device (e.g., AllJoyn router
installed on the Wi-Fi Access Point). The AJTCL uses the AllJoyn
service advertisement and discovery process to discover the
AllJoyn router via a BusNode well-known name. After the
discovery phase, the AJTCL establishes a connection with
the discovered AllJoyn router over TCP. Once connected with
the AllJoyn router, the thin app is just like any other
application endpoint on the AllJoyn distributed bus.

**NOTE:** More than one thin application can connect to a given AllJoyn router.

A thin app can act as an AllJoyn service provider, an AllJoyn
service consumer or both. It follows the same session establishment
procedures as AllJoyn standard apps to accept sessions from and/or
connect to sessions with other remote apps, which can be another
AllJoyn thin app or AllJoyn standard app.

## Functional architecture

The following figure shows the detailed functional architecture
for an AllJoyn thin application. A thin app includes app-specific
code (app code) and the AJTCL. As part of the app code, a thin
app can include one or more AllJoyn service frameworks which
include Onboarding, Configuration, and Notification service
frameworks. App Code also includes app-specific AllJoyn services
if the thin app is acting as an AllJoyn service provider.

![img thin-app-functional-arch][]

**Figure:** Thin app functional architecture

The AJTCL consists of some key functional modules as shown in
the previous figure, among other supported functions. These include
Bus Connection Manager, About, Messaging and App Authentication modules.

* The Bus Connection Manger module provides discovery and
connection establishment with a nearby AllJoyn router (BusNode).
* The About module provides advertisement and discovery
functions for thin app. It supports sending out the Announcement
sessionless signal for the thin app over distributed AllJoyn bus.
* The Messaging module provides marshaling/unmarshaling for AllJoyn
messages and routing these to the connected AllJoyn router.
* The App Authentication module provides application-level authentication
and security between thin app and remote AllJoyn apps. The ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX
auth mechanism is supported in the AJTCL for releases before the 14.06 release.
This auth mechanism is removed from AJTCL in the 14.06 release.
Starting from the 14.06 release, the AJTCL supports a new set of
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)-based auth mechanisms
as described in [App layer authentication][app-layer-auth].

## AJTCL-to-AllJoyn router connection

Upon startup, the thin application initiates the process of
discovery and connection establishment with an AllJoyn router
on another standard AllJoyn-enabled device. This is done using
the name-based discovery mechanism.

An AllJoyn router that supports hosting connections for thin apps
advertises a BusNode well-known name. The advertised well-known
name can be one or both of the following:

* Generic BusNode well-known name "org.alljoyn.BusNode"
driven by the AllJoyn router configuration
* Specific BusNode well-known name advertised by an application
attached to the AllJoyn router, meant for discovery only by
related thin applications.

The AllJoyn router advertises the BusNode well-known name quietly,
that is, the advertisement messages are not sent out
gratuitously by the AllJoyn router. Instead, the AllJoyn router
only sends out the BusNode well-known name advertisement in
response to a query from a thin app. Also, the advertisement
message is sent out quietly via unicast back to the requester
(instead of being sent over multicast). This logic is meant
to minimize the network traffic generated as a result of
thin app-related discovery of an AllJoyn router.

The AllJoyn router limits the number of simultaneous connections
with thin applications in the AllJoyn network. This limit is
configurable as '`max_remote_clients_tcp`' via the router
config file. The AllJoyn router stops advertising all BusNode
names when the '`max_remote_clients_tcp`' limit is reached and resumes when the
current number of thin app connections drop down below the limit.

The connection process between the AJTCL and the AllJoyn router
is split into the following phases:

* Discovery phase: The AJTCL discovers an AllJoyn router on
the AllJoyn proximal network via the BusNode name-based
discovery mechanism. The overall discovery timeout is specified
by the thin app in the `FindBusAndConnect()` API call.
Starting from the 14.12 release, the AJTCL supports mDNS-based
discovery along with legacy discovery for discovering AllJoyn
routers. Logic for this phase is captured below for pre-14.12 TCL
and 14.12 TCL.
  The AJTCL sends out a WHO-HAS message for the BusNode
  well-known name following a backoff schedule. The IS-AT
  message is sent over unicast to the AJTCL by the
  AllJoyn router advertising that BusNode name.
* Connection phase: The AJTCL establishes a TCP connection
with the AllJoyn router based on the connection details
received in the discovery response.
* Authentication phase: SASL anonymous authentication is used
by the AJTCL to authenticate and start using services of the
AllJoyn router.

As part of the connection establishment, the AJTCL also exchanges
the AllJoyn protocol version (AJPV) with the AllJoyn router.
If the AllJoyn router supports a lower AllJoyn protocol version
than the minimum AJPV the thin app requires, the connection
process fails. This failure or an authentication failure will
result in the routing node being added to the blacklist, described
in [Router blacklisting][RN blacklisting].
For the first-time connecting with any AllJoyn router, this
connection establishment process also generates a local GUID
for the AJTCL and sends it to the AllJoyn router.

### Pre-14.12 router discovery

The following figure shows the message flow for the pre-14.12
release for the AJTCL discovering and connecting with the
AllJoyn router.

![img RN Discovery pre-1412][]

**Figure:** Pre-14.12 router discovery and connection

The AJTCL sends out a WHO-HAS message for the BusNode well-known
name following the message schedule as described in
[WHO-HAS message schedule][WHO-HAS schedule].
The response IS-AT message is sent over unicast to the AJTCL
by the AllJoyn router advertising that BusNode name. Any
responses received from the AllJoyn routers on the blacklist
are ignored.

After router discovery, the rest of the AJTCL logic is same as
described above in [AJTCL-to-AllJoyn router connection][tcl-RN connect].

#### WHO-HAS message schedule

Prior to the 14.12 release, the AJTCL supports the following
retry schedule for sending WHO-HAS discovery messages:

1. Send the WHO-HAS message once a second for 10 seconds.
2. Wait 10 seconds, then send another WHO-HAS message.
3. Wait 20 seconds, then send another WHO-HAS message.
4. Wait 40 seconds, then send another; repeat until the overall discovery
timeout expires.

### 14.12 router discovery

The following figure shows the message flow for the 14.12 release
for the AJTCL discovering and connecting with the AllJoyn router.

![img RN Discovery 1412][]

**Figure:** 14.12 router discovery and connection

The AJTCL supports both mDNS and legacy discovery mechanism. If the
AJTCL minimum AJPV is lower than "10", the AJTCL can connect
to routers prior to the 14.06 release. In this case, the TCL
generates and sends out both WHO-HAS and mDNS query messages
for the BusName prefix. The schedule for sending these messages
is described in [Discovery message schedule][discovery msg sched].

The discovery response (either an mDNS response or IS-AT message)
is sent over unicast to the AJTCL by the AllJoyn router advertising
that BusNode name. The mDNS responses may include a key-value pair
indicating the protocol version (the key is 'ajpv') of the
transmitting AllJoyn router (this was added in 14.12 release).
The value of ajpv is used to ignore the discovery response if
the version is less than the minimum required by the thin app.
If both IS-AT and mDNS responses are received by AJTCL at the
same time, the mDNS response is processed first. Responses received
from the AllJoyn routers on the blacklist are ignored.

After router discovery, rest of the AJTCL logic is same as
described above in [AJTCL-to-AllJoyn router connection][tcl-RN connect].

#### Discovery message schedule

The AJTCL supports a retry schedule for sending discovery messages.
It will also selectively send WHO-HAS messages depending on the
minimum protocol version the thin app requests; if the minimum
version is less than 10 it will send both an mDNS query and a
WHO-HAS message. The retry schedule applies to both types of
discovery messages and is as follows:

1. Send a burst of three discovery message(s) and pause 1.1 seconds. Repeat 10
times.
2. Wait 10.1 seconds, then send another burst of three messages.
3. Wait 20.1 seconds, then send another burst of three messages.
4. Wait 40.1 seconds, then send another burst of three messages.
Repeat until the overall discovery timeout expires.

The addition of the 100 msec on the wait intervals ensures that
all possible 100ms slots are covered as quickly as possible.
This increases the likelihood of successful receipt of multicast
packets over Wi-Fi.

### Router Selection

Starting in the in the 15.04 release a feature called Router Selection was
introduced. This feature enables an AJTCL to select the most desirable AllJoyn
router. The detailed [design description][design desc] is available for download
on the Core Working Group [Wikipage][Core Wiki].

The following figure shows the message flow for a 15.04 AJTCL discovering and
connecting with a 15.04 AllJoyn router using router selection.

![img RN Discovery with RS][]

**Figure:** Router discovery using Router Selection

At a high level the feature is implemented in two parts:

1. The router uses a number of both static and dynamic parameters, including
power source, mobility, as well as connection availability and capacity, to
calculate a **rank**, which is communicated via the Priority field of the mDNS
response packet described above in [14.12 router discovery][RN discovery 1412].
Details of the algorithm to calculate the rank, and how that is converted into
the a DNS Priority value are in the [design description][design desc].

2. AJTCL will wait a minimum of 5 seconds collecting discovery responses. For
each response received the processing (described above in [14.12 router
discovery][RN discovery 1412]) related to the 'ajpv' key-value pair and
blacklisting takes place. Once the wait time is complete AJTCL will connect to
the router with the highest rank it has received to that point.  If there is a
tie, or none of the discovery responses it receives contain a rank, it will
randomly select among the equivalent routers and connect. After router
discovery, the rest of the AJTCL logic is same as described above in
[AJTCL-to-AllJoyn router connection][tcl-RN connect].

### Router blacklisting

Starting in the in the 15.04 release a feature called router blacklisting was
added. This feature enables an AJTCL to track routers that are incompatible and
avoid attempting to connect to them again. In order to track incompatible
routers (as determined during connection establishment), a blacklist has been
implemented. The blacklist ensures discovery responses for routers on the
blacklist are ignored.

The explicit criteria for adding a router to the blacklist
is a connection failure either because authentication does
not complete successfully, or because the protocol version
of the router does not meet the minimum required by the thin app.
The default size of the blacklist is 16 entries; the addition of
a 17th router will over-write the first in the list (i.e.,
the list is actually a circular buffer). The blacklist only
persists until the thin app is restarted.

### AJTCL and AllJoyn router compatibility

The following table captures the compatibility matrix between
the AJTCL and AllJoyn router across the AllJoyn 14.02 and 14.06
releases. The AJTCL using the 14.06 release is only compatible
with a 14.02 AllJoyn router if the router does not require AJTCL
authentication. The AJTCL default minimum protocol version
in the 14.12 AJTCL is set to 11 (the version of the 14.12
AllJoyn router), but can be changed by the thin application
if it does not need to use the NGNS feature.

#### AJTCL and AllJoyn router compatibility

| AJTCL / Router | 14.02 (AJTCL auth enabled) | 14.06 (AJTCL auth disabled) | 14.06 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **14.02** | Compatible | Compatible | Compatible |
| **14.06 (thin app not using NGNS)** | Incompatible | Compatible | Compatible |
| **14.06 (thin app using NGNS)** | Incompatible | Incompatible | Compatible |

### Detecting a router link failure

The AJTCL provides a mechanism for the thin application to
implement a probing mechanism to detect connectivity failures
with the AllJoyn router. This can be achieved by invoking the
`SetBusLinkTimeout()` API provided by the AJTCL. The thin app
specifies a timeout value (with minimum timeout of 40 seconds)
as part of this API. If no link activity is detected during
this time period, the AJTCL sends probe packets every 5 seconds
over the router link. If no acknowledgment is received for three
consecutive probe packets, an error is returned to the thin application.

At this point, the thin app should re-initiate discovery for the AllJoyn router.

## Thin app functionality

As mentioned previously, the AJTCL supports all of the key
AllJoyn core functionality as a standard core library. APIs
are provided as part of the AJTCL for the thin app to invoke
core functionality. The AJTCL in turn generates appropriate
AllJoyn format messages (for method_call/reply, signals etc.)
to invoke related APIs on the AllJoyn router. The AJTCL sends
the generated AllJoyn messages to the AllJoyn router to accomplish
the given functionality. The thin app message flow for core
functionality is similar to the standard app with the key difference
that the thin app is connected remotely with the AllJoyn router.

The following figure shows an example message flow for a thin
app discovering a well-known name prefix.

**NOTE:** The AJTCL and AllJoyn router exchange data using AllJoyn
messages (method_call/reply and signals).

![img RN Discovery][]

**Figure:** Thin app discovering a well-known-name prefix

The AJTCL provides support for following core AJ functionality:

* Service Discovery and Advertisement:  Both legacy Name Service
and Next-Gen Name Service functions are supported.
* About advertisement
* Session establishment
* Sessionless signals
* App layer authentication
* The AJTCL provides app layer authentication so that thin app
can implement secure interfaces and also access secure
interfaces on other AllJoyn providers.
* New authentication schemes are supported in the 14.06 release
(see [App layer authentication][app-layer-auth]).

Thin apps can also include existing AllJoyn service framework
functionality by bundling thin app-specific libraries provided
for these service frameworks.

## App layer authentication

The AJTCL provides support for app layer authentication for
the thin app to implement and access secure AllJoyn services.
App layer authentication schemes supported are different in
release prior to the 14.06 release and starting from the 14.06
release as described below.

Prior to the 14.06 release, the AJTCL supports ALLJOYN _PIN_KEYX
auth mechanism for app layer authentication. Also, SASL protocol
is used for authentication.

Starting from the 14.06 release, ALLJOYN _PIN_KEYX auth mechanism
is removed from AJTCL. New Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral
(ECDHE)-based auth mechanism were added to the AJTCL:

* ECDHE_NULL is an anonymous key agreement. There is no PIN or pass-phrase
required.
* ECDHE_PSK is a key agreement authenticated with a pre-shared
key like a PIN, pass-phrase, or symmetric key.
* ECDHE_ECDSA is a key agreement authenticated with an asymmetric
key validated with an ECDSA signature.

The use of SASL protocol for authentication is removed from the
AJTCL in the 14.06 release. Instead, an AllJoyn-based protocol
is used for app layer authentication.

### Auth compatibility

A 14.06 thin app cannot interact with a 14.02 thin app over secure
interfaces and vice versa because these apps support different types
of auth mechanisms. These apps can still talk to each other over non-secure
interfaces.

The following table shows the thin app compatibility matrix across the 14.02 and
14.06 releases.

| 14.02 provider thin app | 14.06 consumer thin app |
|---|---|
| With secure interfaces | Incompatible |
| With non-secure interfaces | Compatible |

| 14.06 provider thin app | 14.02 consumer thin app |
|---|---|
| With secure interfaces | Incompatible |
| With non-secure interfaces | Compatible |

# iOS/OSX - Basic Sample App

## Running Basic Sample - iOS

* Add a brief explanation of what Basic Client/Service are & how they work.

### Prerequisites

* Follow steps in "Building - iOS OSX" section to build and install the Basic Client & Service sample apps on two iOS devices.
* Both iOS devices must be connected to the same WiFi network
  * is there a min/max iOS version we need to put in here???

### Run Basic Client & Service
1. Launch the Basic Client app on one iOS device.
2. The Basic Client app screen should look similar to this:

  ![][basic-client-screen-1]

3. Launch the Basic Service app on a second iOS device.
4. The screen should look similar to this:

  ![][basic-service-screen-1]

5. In the Basic Client app, press the 'Call Service' button. This will cause the client to try and find the service, connect to the service, and execute a sample bus method.
6. The Basic Client app screen should look like this:

  ![][basic-client-screen-3]

7. The Basic Service app screen should look like this:

  ![][basic-service-screen-2]

# Building

The AllJoyn&trade; framework is a software library that will be linked into your project.

Each platform and language binding have their own ways to accomplish this.

Depending on the target platform, check out the recommended steps to get you up and running:
* [Android][android]
* [Linux][linux]
* [Thin - Linux][thin_linux]
* [iOS/OSX][ios_osx]
* [Windows][windows]

NOTE: If changes are required to the AllJoyn Core, see the relevant section on how to build.

# Tutorial

Congratulations on wanting to learn more about the AllJoyn&trade; framework and how to write your very first application.

It would be beneficial to read through the terms so that you have some awareness prior to reviewing these tutorials, but it is not required.  These tutorials will present the thought process in writting a first application.  The application produced will be fully functional and may contain some AllJoyn framework functionality that you may choose to not use in your final application. The intent is to cover the entire use of the SDK so one should no longer be a newbie after going through the [Core][core] section.

Writing your first application using:

* [Core][core]

<!-- Place holder links
    * [Notification][notification]
    * [Control Panel][controlpanel]
    * [Configuration][config]
    * [Onboarding][onboarding]
-->

# About API Guide - iOS

## Reference code

The reference code consists of service and client implementations of the About feature.

### Classes used to send AboutData

| Service class | Description |
|---|---|
| AboutService | Class the implements the org.alljoyn.About interface. |
| AboutIconService | Class that implements the org.alljoyn.Icon interface. |
| PropertyStore | Interface that supplies the list of properties required for Announce signal payload and GetAboutData(). |

### Classes used to receive AboutData

| Client class | Description |
|---|---|
| AboutClient | Helper class for discovering About Service that provides access to the Announcements and to the AboutService. It listens for Announcements sent using the org.alljoyn.About interface. |
| AboutIconClient | Helper class that provides access to the AboutIconService. |

## Obtain the About feature

See the [Building iOS/OS X section][building-ios] for 
instructions on compiling the About feature.

## Build an application that uses About Service

The following steps provide the high-level process to build an 
application that will broadcast AboutData.

1. Create the base for the AllJoyn&trade; application.
2. Implement PropertyStore to produce an AboutData. (See 
[Create a PropertyStore Implementation][create-propertystore-implementation].)
3. Instantiate a PropertyStore.
4. Create and register the AboutService, providing it with 
the PropertyStore.
5. Announce the AboutService.

## Build an application that uses About Client

The following steps provide the high-level process to build an 
application that will receive AboutData.

1. Create the base for the AllJoyn application.
2. Create and register an AnnouncementReceiver providing 
it with the AnnounceListener.
3. Create and use the AboutClient.

## Setting Up the AllJoyn Framework

Every AllJoyn application requires a base set to be in place 
before implementing specific features that include creating a 
BusAttachment and connecting to the AllJoyn framework.

### Create instance of BusAttachment

```objc
self.clientBusAttachment = [[AJNBusAttachment alloc]
initWithApplicationName:APPNAME allowRemoteMessages:ALLOWREMOTEMESSAGES];
```

### Create password for the bundled router

NOTE: Thin libraries at AllSeen Alliance version 14.06 or higher 
do not require this step.

To allow thin libraries to connect to the bundled router, 
the router requires a password.

```objc
[AJNPasswordManager setCredentialsForAuthMechanism:@"ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX" usingPassword:@"000000"];
```

### Start and connect the BusAttachment

Once created, the BusAttachment must be connected to the AllJoyn framework.

```objc
[self.clientBusAttachment connectWithArguments:@""];
```

### Advertise the router

The application should advertise the router so that the thin 
library can find it and connect to it.

```objc
[self.clientBusAttachment requestWellKnownName:@"quiet@org.alljoyn.BusNode.AboutService withFlags:kAJNBusNameFlagDoNotQueue];

[clientBusAttachment advertiseName:@"quiet@org.alljoyn.BusNode.AboutService.542e8562-e29b-89c2-b456-
334455667788"]
```

## Implementing an Application that Uses AboutService

Implementing an About Service requires creating and registering 
an instance of the AboutService class.

NOTE: Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started and 
connected before implementing the AboutService. See [Setting Up the AllJoyn Framework][set-up-alljoyn-framework] 
for the code snippets. Code in this chapter references a 
variable `clientBusAttachment` (the BusAttachment variable name).

### Declare listener class

Typically, a `shouldAcceptSessionJoinerNamed:onSessionPort 
withSessionOptions:` callback in `SessionPortListener` has a 
check to allow or disallow access. Since the AboutService 
requires access to any application using AboutClient with a 
specific port, return true when this callback is triggered.

```objc
self.aboutSessionPortListener = [[CommonBusListener alloc]
initWithServicePort:1000];

self.serviceBusAttachment registerBusListener:self.aboutSessionPortListener];
```

### Bind session port

NOTE: This step is not mandatory if you are only sending an 
announcement. To allow incoming connections, the formation 
of a session is needed. The AllJoyn framework must be told 
that connections are allowed.

```objc
AJNSessionOptions *opt = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc] 
   initWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages 
   supportsMultipoint:false proximity:kAJNProximityAny 
   transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];

serviceStatus = [self.serviceBusAttachment 
   bindSessionOnPort:1000 withOptions:opt 
   withDelegate:self.aboutSessionPortListener];
```

### Create a PropertyStore implementation

The PropertyStore interface is required by the AboutService 
to store the provisioned values for the About interface data 
fields (listed in [About interface data fields][about-interface-data-fields]). 
See the [About Interface Definition][about-interface-definition] 
for more information.

NOTE: It is recommended that OEMs create a shared provisioning 
file that includes the DefaultLanguage, DeviceName, and 
DeviceID fields. This file can be used by developers to manage 
these fields in the AllJoyn services that make use of them.

#### About interface data fields

| Field name | Required | Announced | Signature | 
|---|---|---|---|
| AppId | yes | yes | ay |
| DefaultLanguage | yes | yes | s |
| DeviceName | yes | yes |  |
| DeviceId | yes | yes | s |
| AppName | yes | yes | s |
| Manufacturer | yes | yes | s |
| ModelNumber | yes | yes | s |
| SupportedLanguages | yes | no | as |
| Description | yes | no | s |
| DateofManufacture | no | no | s |
| SoftwareVersion | yes | no | s |
| AJSoftwareVersion | yes | no | s |
| HardwareVersion | no | no | s |
| SupportUrl | no | no | s |

### Sample PropertyStore implementation

An example PropertyStore implementation is provided below 
that specifies the following dictionary of metadata fields:

* Keys are the field names.
* Values are a Map of String to Object entries, where the 
String is the language tag associated with the Object value.

```objc
- (QStatus)fillAboutPropertyStoreImplData
{
   QStatus status;

   // AppId
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setAppId:self.uniqueID];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   // AppName
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setAppName:@"AboutConfig"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
   return status;
   }

   // DeviceId
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDeviceId:@"123375477"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   // DeviceName
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDeviceName:@"Screen"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   // SupportedLangs
   NSArray *languages = @[@"en", @"sp", @"fr"];
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setSupportedLangs:languages];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	DefaultLang
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDefaultLang:@"en"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	ModelNumber
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setModelNumber:@"Wxfy388i"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	DateOfManufacture
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDateOfManufacture:@"10/1/2199"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	SoftwareVersion
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setSoftwareVersion:@"12.20.44"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	AjSoftwareVersion
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setAjSoftwareVersion:[AJNVersion versionInformation]];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	HardwareVersion
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setHardwareVersion:@"355.499. b"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	Description
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"This is an AllJoyn Application" 
      language:@"en"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"Esta es una AllJoyn

   aplicaci√≥n" language:@"sp"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"C'est une AllJoyn application" 
      language:@"fr"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	Manufacturer
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setManufacturer:@"Company" language:@"en"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setManufacturer:@"Empresa" language:@"sp"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setManufacturer:@"Entreprise" language:@"fr"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }

   //	SupportedUrl
   status = [self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setSupportUrl:@"http://www.allseenalliance.org"];
   if (status != ER_OK) {
      return status;
   }
      return status;
   }
```

### Provision PropertyStore with default values

In the application, the PropertyStore instance you created will 
be loaded with the default values. In the sample implementation 
above, the PropertyStore instance is provided with a default values map.

The following subsections highlight provisioning fields 
according to their data type.

#### AppId field

The AppId field is an array of bytes. It is a globally unique 
identifier (GUID) encoded as an array of 16 bytes.

```objc
self.uniqueID = [[NSUUID UUID] UUIDString]; 

[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setAppId:self.uniqueID];
```

#### SupportedLanguages field

The SupportedLanguages field is a list of text strings. 
Some fields can have a language-dependent value that must 
be provided for each of the supported languages.

```objc
NSArray *languages = @[@"en", @"sp", @"fr"]; 

[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setSupportedLangs:languages];
```

#### Non-language-specific fields

Non-language-specific fields support a single supplied text 
string. Following is an example for the ModelNumber field on 
how to insert into the PropertyStore. The code below can be 
used with the field name being replaced by other field names 
listed in [About data interface fields][about-interface-data-fields].

```objc
[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setModelNumber:@"Wxfy388i"];
```

#### Language-dependent fields

Language-dependent fields support a single supplied text string. 
Below is an example for the Description field on how to insert 
into the PropertyStore. The code below can be used with the 
field name being replaced by other field names listed in [About data interface fields][about-interface-data-fields].

```objc
[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"This is an AllJoyn application" language:@"en"];

[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"Esta es una AllJoyn aplicacion" language:@"sp"];

[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@"C'est une AllJoyn application" language:@"fr"];
``` 

### Create the AboutService object

For an application to send AboutData, it requires an instance 
of the AboutService class. AboutServiceImpl is an implementation 
wrapper around AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions 
between About Service and About Client.

```objc
AboutService aboutService = AboutServiceImpl.getInstance();
```

### Start Service mode

Register the relevant BusObjects and add the relevant interfaces 
to the Announcement's ObjectDescription.

```objc
[self.aboutServiceApi startWithBus:self.serviceBusAttachment 
   andPropertyStore:self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl];
```

### Add an AboutIconService (optional)

An application that sends AboutData can be extended to broadcast 
a device. AboutServiceImpl is also an implementation wrapper 
around AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions 
between applications that use the AboutIconClient class.

#### Provision for the Icon content and URL

An Icon is published directly as a byte array or a reference 
URL, and must be provisioned as follows:

```objc
uint8_t aboutIconContent[] = { 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A,
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x49, 0x48, 0x44,
   0x52, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0A, 0x08, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00,

0x00, 0x02, 0x50, 0x58, 0xEA, 0x00,
   0x00, 0x00, 0x04, 0x67, 0x41, 0x4D, 0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0xAF, 0xC8, 0x37, 0x05,

0x8A, 0xE9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x19,
   0x74, 0x45, 0x58, 0x74, 0x53, 0x6F, 0x66, 0x74, 0x77, 0x61, 0x72, 0x65, 0x00,

0x41, 0x64, 0x6F, 0x62, 0x65, 0x20,
   0x49, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x67, 0x65, 0x52, 0x65, 0x61, 0x64, 0x79, 0x71, 0xC9, 0x65,

0x3C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x18, 0x49,
   0x44, 0x41, 0x54, 0x78, 0xDA, 0x62, 0xFC, 0x3F, 0x95, 0x9F, 0x01, 0x37, 0x60,

0x62, 0xC0, 0x0B, 0x46, 0xAA, 0x34,
   0x40, 0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x06, 0x7C, 0x01, 0xB7, 0xED, 0x4B, 0x53, 0x2C, 0x00,

0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x49, 0x45, 0x4E,
   0x44, 0xAE, 0x42, 0x60, 0x82 };

};

NSString *mimeType = @"image/png"; /* This should correspond 
   to the content */ NSString *url = @"http://tinyurl.com/llrqvrb"; 
   /* An alternate access to the Icon
*/
```

#### Create and register DeviceIcon object

Register the relevant BusObjects and add the relevant interfaces 
to the Announcement's ObjectDescription.

```objc
self.aboutIconService = [[AJNAboutIconService alloc] initWithBus:self.serviceBusAttachment 
   mimeType:mimeType url:url content:aboutIconContent csize:csize];

[self.aboutIconService registerAboutIconService];
```

### Advertise to allow connections

```objc
[self.serviceBusAttachment advertiseName:([self.serviceBusAttachment uniqueName])
withTransportMask:(kAJNTransportMaskAny)];
```

### Send the Announcement

```objc
[self.aboutServiceApi announce];
```

### Unregister and delete AboutService and BusAttachment

When your process is done with the AboutService and no longer 
wishes to send announcements, unregister the process from the 
AllJoyn bus and then delete variables used.

```objc
// Stop AboutIcon
[self.serviceBusAttachment unregisterBusObject:self.aboutIconService];
self.aboutIconService = nil;

// Delete AboutServiceApi [self.aboutServiceApi destroyInstance]; 
   self.aboutServiceApi = nil;

// Delete AboutPropertyStoreImpl self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl = nil;

// Bus attachment cleanup
[self.serviceBusAttachment cancelAdvertisedName:[self.serviceBusAttachment 
   uniqueName] withTransportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];

[self.serviceBusAttachment unbindSessionFromPort:SERVICE_PORT];

// Delete AboutSessionPortListener
[self.serviceBusAttachment unregisterBusListener:self.aboutSessionPortListener];
self.aboutSessionPortListener = nil;

// Stop bus attachment
[self.serviceBusAttachment stop];
self.serviceBusAttachment = nil;
```

## Implementing an Application that Uses AboutClient

To implement an application to receive AboutData, use the 
AboutClient class. By using the AboutClient class, your 
application is notified when About Service instances 
send announcements.

Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started and 
connected before implementing an About Client. See [Setting 
Up the AllJoyn Framework][set-up-alljoyn-framework] for the 
code snippets. Code in this chapter references a variable 
`self.clientBusAttachment` (the BusAttachment variable name).

### Setup to receive the Announce signal

In order to receive the Announce signal from an application 
using AboutService, a class implementation of AJNAnnouncementListener 
protocol must be created.

#### Create class to implement AJNAnnouncementListener protocol

This declaration of a class will allow for the signals to 
be received. It must implement the pure virtual function Announce.

```objc
@interface sampleClass <AJNAnnouncementListener>

- (void)announceWithVersion:(uint16_t)version 
                       port:(uint16_t)port
                    busName:(NSString *)busName 
         objectDescriptions:(NSMutableDictionary *)objectDescs
                  aboutData:(NSMutableDictionary **)aboutData {
// add your implementation here
}
```

#### Implement the Announce method that handles the Announce signal

With everything linked up using the AllJoyn framework, the 
method registered with the AllJoyn framework will be executed 
upon receipt of an Announce signal.

Because every application is different, as a developer you 
must process the AboutData and determine the following:

* How it should be rendered in the UI.
* When to request the data that is not contained in the Announce signal.
* Any logic that is needed.

#### Register the AJNAnnouncementListener

When registering an announcement listener, specify which 
interfaces the application is interested in. The code below 
shows a listener registered to receive Announce signals 
that include an object implementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.

```objc
self.announcementReceiver = [[AJNAnnouncementReceiver alloc]
initWithAnnouncementListener:self andBus:self.clientBusAttachment];

const char* interfaces[] = { [INTERFACE_NAME UTF8String] }; 

[self.announcementReceiver registerAnnouncementReceiverForInterfaces:interfaces
   withNumberOfInterfaces:1];
```

### Using ping to determine presence

The AJNBusAttachment pingPeer member function can be used to 
determine if a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce 
signal can be stale so it may be useful to ping the device to 
see if it is still present and responsive before attempting 
to form a connection.

NOTE: The AJNBusAttachment pingPeer method makes a bus call. 
If pingPeer is called inside an AllJoyn callback, `AJNBusAttachment 
enableConcurrentCallbacks` must be called first.

```objc
// When pinging a remote bus name wait a max of 5 seconds
[self.clientBusAttachment enableConcurrentCallbacks];
QStatus status = [self.clientBusAttachment pingPeer:busName 
  withTimeout:5000];
if (ER_OK == status) {
   ...
}
```

### Request non-announced data

If there is a need to request information that is not contained 
in the announcement (meaning they are not marked as announcable), 
complete the tasks in the following subsections.


#### Join a session

Create a session with the application by using the 
BusAttachment JoinSession API.
 
NOTE: The variables name and port are set from the AboutData 
from the Announce method.

```objc
AJNSessionOptions *opt = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc] 
initWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:false 
proximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];


self.sessionId = [self.clientBusAttachment 
      joinSessionWithName:[self.clientInformation.announcement busName]
            onPort:[self.clientInformation.announcement port]
            withDelegate:(nil) options:opt];
```

#### Create AboutClient

Generate an AJNAboutClient and create an instance passing in 
the BusAttachment that was created in [Start and connect the 
BusAttachment][start-connect-busattachment].

```objc
AJNAboutClient *ajnAboutClient = [[AJNAboutClient alloc]
initWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];
```

#### Create AJNAboutIconClient

Generate an AJNAboutIconClient and create an instance passing 
in the BusAttachment created in [Start and connect the BusAttachment][start-connect-busattachment].

```objc
self.ajnAboutIconClient = [[AJNAboutIconClient alloc]
initWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];

[self.ajnAboutIconClient urlFromBusName:announcementBusName url:&url 
sessionId:self.sessionID];
```

### Shutdown

Once you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn 
framework, free the variables used in the application.

```objc
self.clientBusAttachment = nil;
```

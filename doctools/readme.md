# Document Development Tools

## About doctools

The /webdocs/tools/doctools folder contains a number of files and file sets that will
assist you in creating markdown documents:

* readme.md: this file
* template: a folder with a template markdown file and all supporting files (see below)
* cheatsheet.md: a reference file with the most important and useful markdown formatting
  options.

## About the Cheat Sheet

The cheat sheet is a reference file with AllSeen-specific markdown formatting to create
the styles you will need for your document. Use this file to look up the correct formatting
when needed.

**Note:** Markdown comes in a variety of flavours. AllSeen uses the so-called "Github flavour".
This allows a lot more formatting than is used and mentioned in the cheat sheet and the template.
However, in order to keep the creation of markdown documents as simple as possible, we've used
only the basic formatting options. Limiting yourself to these options will help keep your document
simple and concise.

## About the Template

### What Is the Template file?

The template folder contains a file called standard-document.md. This is a fully-formatted,
working document can serve as a basis for a new document. It contains fully-formatted and
working examples of paragraphs, sections and styles you can use for a document.

### How to Use the Template

1. Proceed as follows:
2. Make a copy of the template file.
3. Copy and paste sections that are useful.
4. Replace the template content with your content.
5. Delete template sections you do not need.

**Tip**: only remove the template sections after you have finished the first draft of your
document. As you are writing, you may find that you need to use sections you had not
anticipated. Keeping the template content in your document as you are writing will avoid
your having to create the formatting from scratch.

## Markdown Tools

There are many markdown editors out there, but many of them do not support all markdown
flavours. Especially table formatting is a problem. 
There are also a few programs you can install, but they have the same problem.

### Recommended Tools

#### Text Editors

If you are well-acquainted with the markdown syntax in the cheat sheet, the fastest
way of creating a markdown file is probably using a "simple" text editor.
There a many of them out there. For Windows, the best (free) one by far is the excellent
[notepad ++][np]. On Linux, the standard tools are VIM and Emacs.

The learning-curve for this is a bit steeper, but ultimately well worth the effort.

#### Wysiwyg Tools

If you're less familiar with the syntax or like to see (sort of) what your document will
look like, you can use a wysiwyg tool. There are a number of standalone editors available,
both paying and free, but most of them have trouble with correctly displaying some of the
formatting, specifically tables.

There are also a number of browser-based tools. Two excellent ones are [markable][mk] and [stackedit][se]. 

Both support all formatting used by the AllSeen Alliance (specifically the table formatting)
and are very user-friendly. They are fully browser-based and allow you to save files inside
and outside your browser, so you can write your document first and worry about where to put
it in the webdocs/docs folder later.

Even if you you are a markdown-junk, these tools help you to see what your document
what the look of your document will be (more or less, since the AllSeen website uses a
different style sheet than these tools.We highly recommend using either one of these.

**Tip:** To test these tools and hone your markdown-skills, simply copy the text of the
cheat sheet or standard document template in one of them and have fun with it.

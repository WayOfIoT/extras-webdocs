##Simple ordered list

1. Item One
2. Item Two

##Nested ordered list

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet tail short loin shank     ham capicola. Ground round cow corned beef prosciutto. 

    Tail venison kielbasa ground round 	boudin short ribs biltong hamburger spare ribs jerky.

# TABLES

Not all markdown dialects support tables, but Github fortunately does.  You can also use [Markable](http://markable.in/editor) to preview the markdown code. 

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens "-" for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe "|":

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Cell one      | Cell two
Cell three    | Cell four

For aesthetic purposes, you can also add extra pipes on the ends:

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell one      | Cell two      |
| Cell three    | Cell four     |

Note that the dashes at the top don't need to match the length of the header text exactly:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Red Button    | You will not resist pushing this.|
| Cord          | You know you want to pull it.    |

You can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Red Button    | ~~You will not~~ resist pushing this.|
| Cord          | _You know_ you want to pull it.    |

Finally, by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| left          | centered        | right |
| aligned       | aligned         | aligned |

A colon on the left-most side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the right-most side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on both sides indicates a center-aligned column.

# BACKSLASH ESCAPE

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word with literal asterisks, you can use backslashes before the asterisks, like this:

\* These are literal asterisks. This line is not emphasized. \*

You can escape other formatting characters in the same way.

# URL LINKS

Complete syntax

[Visit GitHub!](http://www.github.com)

Github also auto-formats a link if it recognizes a URL as such:

http://www.github.com

# Links to Other Pages

This is [a link to another page][doc-link].

Here, the [linked doc][folder-doc-link] is in a subfolder.

# ANCHORS

In standard Markdown, place an anchor <a name="abcd"> </a> where you want to link to and refer to it on the same page by [link text](#abcd).

# LINKS

Though there are multiple mechanisms for creating external links, we recommend a) using reference style links, b) using full paths relative to the host, and c) placing link paths at the end of the document. This makes it easier to parse and find links in case we need to make a global search/replace.

Here are a few examples:

This is a link to [an external document in the same dir][id-of-link]

This one links to a [document in a subfolder][id-of-link2]

Note, the actual link path is at the bottom of this document (see the source of this document).

# INSERTING IMAGES

Image links are preceded by "!" . Alt text is put between straight brackets "[]". 

For images hosted locally:

* Use reference style links, 
* Full paths relative to the host, and 
* Put url paths at the end of the document. Example:

![Dummy Image][dummy-image]

For images from the internet, provide the URL instead of the path.

![Darfield] [Darfield]

[doc-link]: linked_doc
[folder-doc-link]: subfolder/linked_doc
[dummy-image]: Images/Dummy.jpg
